          Nintendo’s Ring Fit Adventure is a silly, gentle way to shape up
        </h2>

      <p>Nintendo has a long history when it comes to exercise-driven games.
        I’m dating myself, but I can say I remember playing Track & Field on NES with the Power Pad.
        How far we’ve come! Ring Fit Adventure is a full-body workout for grown-ups, but fun, gentle, and ridiculous
        enough to forget it’s exercise.
      </p>
      <p>The game and accessories were announced in September, coming as a complete surprise even considering Nintendo’s
        constant but hit-and-miss attempts at keeping its players healthy.
        What really threw people off was that this game actually looked like… a game. And so it is!
      </p>
      <p>
        Ring Fit Adventure has you, the unnamed and (naturally) mute protagonist, journeying through a series of worlds
        and levels chasing after Dragaux, a swole dragon who’s infecting the land with… something.
        Maybe he’s not wiping down the equipment afterwards. Come on, man.
